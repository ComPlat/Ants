- instead of x,y,z --> one 3D structure and optimize the length and angle to the adjacent atoms
- PSO optimizes length and angle of binding; Calculate x,y,z coordinates based on length and angle
  --> call xtb
- dont optimize the atoms but the bindings

- Smile to xyz
  - obabel -:"CCO" -O ethanol.xyz --gen3d
- obabel input.smi -O output.mol
  - thereby the atoms and how they are connected to each other is stored
- construct graph based on connections
- optimize length, angles and dihedral for each bond
- traverse graph to reconstruct xyz from bond properties
