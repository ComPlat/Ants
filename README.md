The goal of Ants is to enable global geometry optimization for accurate property prediction of molecular systems.
Written in Fortran, it combines particle swarm optimization (PSO) with DFT energy evaluations to efficiently explore the conformational space and identify global minimum structures.
These optimized low-energy geometries provide a reliable foundation for theoretical studies of both novel and established compounds.
