The goal of Ants is to enable global geometry optimization for accurate property prediction of molecular systems.
It combines particle swarm optimization (PSO) with XTB energy evaluations to explore the conformational space and identify global minimum structures.
These optimized low-energy geometries provide a reliable foundation for theoretical studies of both novel and established compounds.
